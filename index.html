            <p id="summary">The floods in Bangladesh are thought to be the most severe in 100 years. More than a
                third
                of
                the country has
                been submerged. At least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected. The government
                and
                NGOs are struggling to cope with the extent of the disaster and warn of risk of disease as well as
                shortages
                of crucial supplies including food, medication and clean drinking water. More than half a million
                homes
                have
                been damaged.</p>

            <p class="donate-today-paragraph">Over 70% of Sylhet is under water, this is one of the largest regions in
                Bangladesh. Thousands of people
                have fled for safety, while millions have been left stranded due to the monsoon floods across the
                region, with dozens tragically having lost their lives.</p>
            <p class="donate-today-paragraph">Each year, heavy monsoon rains threaten millions of lives across South
                Asia.
                This yearâ€™s monsoon season
                is getting worse by the day, causing widespread damage across Bangladesh. Communities have lost their
                homes, livelihoods and lack access to essential food, water, and basic medical assistance.</p>
